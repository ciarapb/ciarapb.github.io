I am currently a postdoc at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona) working with [Gabor Lugosi](http://www.econ.upf.edu/~lugosi/) and [Gergely Neu](http://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/). 

My research interests lie mainly in the design and analysis of algorithms for sequential decision problems, specifically multi-armed bandit problems.

Previously I did my PhD at [STOR-i](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/) at Lancaster University where I was supervised by [Steffen Grunewalder](https://grunewalder.blog/).
