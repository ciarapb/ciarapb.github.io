Website (and source code) for the trybandits game used for teaching sixth form students (16-18) about mult-armed bandits.

The files trybanditsrand.html and d3banditsrand.js correspond to the case where the reward probabilities of the arms are sampled randomly at the beginning og the game. This means that whenever we refresh, or load the website on different computers, the reward probabilities of the arms are different. In the original versions of the files (index.html and d3bandits.js), the reward distributions are fixed.
